## A deterministic model for the spread of measles within a secondary school
As part of my co-op at York University, I have set a goal for myself to create a simple model of how measles would spread within a secondary school. 

The accuracy of this model is at best questionable, mostly because as populations get smaller, stochasticity because more and more of a major player in the behavior of the infection and this holds especially true in a confined area such as a secondary school. This is somehow compensated with a set of transmission matrices that will hopefully describe to some *reasonable* accuracy how students in different grades interact with each other.
